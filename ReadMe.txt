*Requirements:
Needs a Windows operating system to run the .exe file
It requires the .ico file in the folder

NOTE: Deleting "phonebook.db" results in loss of entire database
      The program will create a new clean database file if deleted

The C++ file depicts the digital Phonebook model using linked lists.
We have simply made a GUI using Python to depict the working of our PhoneBook using sqlite3 database
